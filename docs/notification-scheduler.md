# Notification Scheduler

The AKHLAK 360 MVP includes a reminder command for pending assessment assignments:

```bash
php artisan assessment:send-reminders
```

The command checks active assessment periods, skips assignments past the deadline, and sends reminders every 3 days while preventing duplicate reminders for the same assignment on the same day.

In-app reminders are stored in the `notifications` table. Email delivery uses Laravel Mail and defaults to the log mailer for this MVP, so local reminder emails are written to Laravel logs unless `MAIL_MAILER` is changed.

To run the Laravel scheduler during local simulation:

```bash
php artisan schedule:work
```

The scheduler runs `assessment:send-reminders` daily at 08:00. Production deployment can use the same command with the company scheduler or cron strategy.
